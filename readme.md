## About The Project

Ecommerce Simulator made only with RestfulAPIs with express-js backend. The interaction is completely through the terminal with an optimized PostgreSQL database. The database is optimized for transactions, searching, creating your own marketplace, and all other functionalities you would find in an ecommerce application.

There is also Swagger Documentation for reference on how to use the APIs. That can be foudn by running the `main.js` file in the `Ecommerce OpenAPI Doc` and running your localhost on port `8002`
